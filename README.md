Ascential Market Share Analytics Team

This README is designed to introduce our new workspace and define the parameters of operation. The goal of setting up the GitHub repository is to provide a place for code-sharing on our team. There has been an organization group added for both Amazon and Walmart team members  (Edge-Share-Digital-Commerce)

The following shows that the main branch is active for our dc_analytics

As the Analytics team grows and progresses with client workload, we can use the dc_analytics repository to share/update code files as well as track changes to text(.txt) files and table (.csv) files. 

New SQL/Python Developments can be used for back-end collaboration accross the team and using git blame- to review the contributions(with timestamp and user tags) allows us to funnel our work into a main source of team output as it relates to our common goals. 

At this point in time I have started using Python/SQL directly on VS code to produce sub-repository work that will contribute to companywide developments as we push further towards the merging of Flywheel and the 6 pillars of the company. Listed below are the Organization Repositories for digital-commerce-analytics:
    1) walmart_ms (branch structure: main > analyst_name & python/sql reports > ticket_work & personal projects)
    2) amazon_ms (Main > analyst name & client-related work > personal code files & project work)
    3) demo_repository (a playground for experimental coding work: feel free to addd any branch you want)
