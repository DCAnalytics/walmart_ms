Ascential Market Share Analytics Team

This README is designed to introduce our new workspace and define the parameters of operation. The goal of setting up the GitHub repository is to provide a place for code-sharing on our team. There has been an organization group added for both Amazon and Walmart team members  (Edge-Share-Digital-Commerce)

As the Analytics team grows and progresses with client workload, we can use the dc_analytics repository to share/update code files as well as track changes to text(.txt) files and table (.csv) files. 

New SQL/Python Developments can be used for back-end collaboration accross the team and using git blame- to review the contributions(with timestamp and user tags) allows us to funnel our work into a main source of team output as it relates to our common goals.
