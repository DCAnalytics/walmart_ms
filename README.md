dc_analytics This README is designed to introduce our new workspace and define the parameters of operation. Abhi and Lara have recently shared the format for folder sharing in the GoogleDrive platform and the goal of setting up the GitHub dc_analytics repository is to mirror the well-defined structure and include the conveniene of code-sharing on our team. ![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100659541/217077972-28313624-9b22-4fe6-af3c-16ab07a4d3c3.png)The following shows that the main branch is active for our dc_analytics

As an intro to the analytic repository a table of summaries of all 14 L1 Categories in the Walmart Market Share datasets are shared below. There has also been a 'Walmart Master Table' that is created and shared in the google drive: this table includes the 1,012,639 distinct rpc items for the Walmart predictive v5 data.

As the Analytics team grows and progresses with client workload, we can use the dc_analytics repository to share/update code files as well as track changes to text(.txt) files and table (.csv) files.
